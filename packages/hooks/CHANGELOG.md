* [#293](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/web3-ui/pull/293) [`be483bd`](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/web3-ui/commit/be483bd66022466578ed8ab7782db04b04c1b6c3) Thanks [@Dhaiwat10](https://github.com/Dhaiwat10)! - !! BREAKING CHANGE !!
  `ethers` has been moved to peer dependencies for both the `components` and `hooks` packages. (It was already a peer dependency for `core`)

  This means that you will users will now have to install `ethers` along side our packages manually.

  execute('Hello', { value: '10' });
  ```
